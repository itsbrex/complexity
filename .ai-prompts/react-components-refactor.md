I need an advanced, nuanced refactoring of this React component that goes beyond surface-level changes. Provide a detailed transformation that addresses:

1. **Performance Optimization**

- Identify potential performance bottlenecks
- Implement memoization strategies
- Reduce unnecessary re-renders

2. **Architectural Improvements**

- Apply appropriate design patterns
- Improve component composition
- Enhance separation of concerns

3. **Modern React Practices**

- Convert to functional component with hooks
- Implement advanced hook patterns
- Leverage React best practices

4. **Code Quality Enhancements**

- Improve type safety (preferably with TypeScript)
- Add comprehensive prop validation
- Implement error boundaries and fallback mechanisms

5. **Advanced State Management**

- Evaluate current state management approach
- Suggest potential state management refactoring (context, custom hooks, etc.)
- Implement more predictable state transitions

6. **Hooks Usage**

- Group related hooks at the top of the component
- Extract complex hook logic into custom hooks
- Follow consistent naming patterns for hooks
- Keep hook dependencies minimal and explicit
- Organize hooks in order of importance:
  1. State hooks (useState)
  2. Context/Store hooks (useContext, useStore)
  3. Side effect hooks (useEffect)
  4. Memoization hooks (useMemo, useCallback)
  5. Custom hooks
- Consider splitting components if using too many hooks (>5-7)
- Use hook composition to build more complex behaviors
- Keep effects focused on a single responsibility
- Avoid nested hook declarations
- Document complex hook interactions with comments

Provide a detailed explanation of each transformation, including:

- Rationale for changes
- Potential trade-offs
- Performance impact
- Code complexity analysis

Please present the refactored component with inline comments explaining critical design decisions.
